question number 25

if odd number found skip next two values 
eg;
:1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20;

(if 1 occurs then skip 2,3 the next num =4)

i think there is a connection....

            1+3=4
            4+1=5
            5+3=8
            8+1=9
            9+3=12
            12+1=13
            13+3=16
            etc...


            just check this one...thank u
